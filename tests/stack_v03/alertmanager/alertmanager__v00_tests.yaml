global:
  resolve_timeout: 5m

route:
  receiver: 'gmail-notifications'
  repeat_interval: 1m

##..this env-expose method for secrets DOESNT work at AlertManager config level (but works fine at DockerCompose config level)
receivers:
- name: 'gmail-notifications'
  email_configs:
  - to: "${GMAIL_LOGIN}"
    from: "${GMAIL_LOGIN}"
    smarthost: smtp.gmail.com:587
    auth_username: "${GMAIL_LOGIN}"
    auth_identity: "${GMAIL_LOGIN}"
    auth_password: "${GMAIL_PSSWD}"
    send_resolved: true
